			Most people would think that dogs (and cats) are just second class citizens living in their home, just something that belongs to you. That's not how Bubba was.
			<br><br>
			Bubba came into our lives with I was just starting grammar school. He was a baby, just as I was. We loved and nurtured him with all that we could. For the first few years of his life, we fed him human food which was clearly a mistake that led to his illness. We didn't know any better, he wouldn't eat dog food or treats. 
			<br><br>
			We spoiled him. Treats and toys scattered around the house. Purchased multiple beds for him, only to find him sleeping on the linoleum floor. He wasn't just an animal, he was like my sibling. I grew up with him, but time has caught up with him. 
			<br><br>
			I remember I woke up one morning and my dad came into my room telling me to hurry downstairs to see what my mom had brought back the night before. A new puppy, scratch that, a new member of the family. All I remember is how I didn't want to go to school, all I wanted to do was welcome him home. 
			<br><br>
			There were nights where he was constantly on edge from thunderstorms to fireworks on the fourth of July. On those days, he would run up stairs and *knock* on my door, waiting to come in. When my door was open he would just plop down in the middle of the room as if it was his regular spot. 
			<br><br>
			The first picture here is the most recent that I have of him. This is a picture of him being around 10lbs, it made me sad just holding him knowing that he wasn't eating as much as he should be. 
			<br><br>
			I'd like to think that he lived a great life. Cause he sure blessed mine. I will never forget how much happiness this one being brought me.
