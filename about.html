## About
I am currently a 3rd year undergraduate at Illinois Tech studying computer science. In my most recent semester, I have found an interest in databases and information retrieval. However, I am excited to explore new fields of CS. I enjoy hitting the slopes to clear my mind; Occasionally, I get distracted by cute puppy instagrams.
