			<p><center>Hi my name is Ariel and here is my ITMD361 Final Project </center><br>
				I have chosen my beloved dog as the theme of my website in honor of his recent passing 
				He was a great dog, he loved me endlessly and was there for me when I started Kindergarten
				and I was hoping he would stay with me through graduation. Nevertheless, this is a page to 
				remember him and I hopefully will upload this to share with the rest of my family.
