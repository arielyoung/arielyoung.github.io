			<h1> Bubs Bubba Paco Simba </h1>
      <p class="bod"> Bubs was brought into my life in September of 2001. He was a 
      hyper little fella. He was as white as snow and could get lost during the 
      winter storms. He was a fluffy pom. He was loved, treated like a king. He lived 
      a long life, 15 years. He was spoiled, plentiful treats, beds and toys. But 
      he always chose to sleep in front of the door. Like a guard dog, standing at 
      14lbs. Its like he never slept during the earlier years. But as time went on, 
      all he could do was lay down. He had no strength to stand up and would plop 
      down when he legs gave out. He loved to eat human food (cause what dog 
      wouldn't) and refused to eat dog food. Eventually we had to stop and give him 
      some healthy dog food. For his birthdays he got plenty of doggy cupcakes and 
      treats. Family dinners he got turkey and whatever he could eat. Yep. he was 
      great. Always a smile on his face. Barking away at the walls when he sensed 
      something wrong. Scratching at our bedroom doors for attention. Hiding in my 
      room during the fourth of july. Yep it was great. My dearly beloved bubs.
